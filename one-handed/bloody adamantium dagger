bloody adamantium dagger
The blade of this intimidating dagger is soaked in blood which is dipping in visible drops to the ground. Edge of it is heavily serrated towards the handle, is rather heavily curved into shape of crescent, and sharp at both sides. Dagger has no guard and ends in chaotically bound with black leather stripes. It is hard to tell whether weapon is actually useful, but it surely looks disgusting.
