colorful long linen skirt
This light skirt is fashioned out of layers of exquisite linen. Each layers is dyed into its own pastel shade, never repeating, seemingly chaotic. Looking for a while, you notice that colors of numerous layers slowly change, yet keeping pleasant dim harmony. Skirt is rather long, ending hand above the ankles. Seemingly not wide, it opens and floats with movement, allowing the wearer not to be restrained by the garment.
