@Skirt of @animal @affinity
The skirt is crafted as a cascade of layers of @rusty @red silk, falling down from the waist. The material is extremely light, so it motions even with slight movement and weakest wind. The garment is monotonous in color of @coral @red, appearing like a flaming field. The skirt ends at ground level, it covers the feet completely and slightly drags over ground.
