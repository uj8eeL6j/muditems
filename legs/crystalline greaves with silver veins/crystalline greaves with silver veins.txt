crystalline greaves with silver veins
These neatly fit greaves are crafted as layers of crystalline matter bound in silver. Material of the craft looks like strange slightly transparent lightly cyan crystal with veins of silver melted into it, with each plate is bound into silver. Armor encloses legs entirely, leaving no exposed spots, yet careful fit, layered structure and free joints in the knees permit wearer to move with relative agility and freedom.
