colorful long linen skirt
This light skirt is fashioned out of layers of exquisite linen.  Each layer is dyed into its own pastel shade, never repeating, seemingly chaotic. Staring for a while, you notice that colors of numerous layers slowly change, yet keep pleasant dim harmony. The skirt is rather long, ending hand above ankles.  Seemingly not wide, it opens and floats with movement, allowing the wearer not to be restrained by the garment.
