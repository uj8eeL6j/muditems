Trousers of @Defence
Long and wide these drousers offer to the wearer concealment of movement one might desire in combat. They are woven out of soft silk of exquisite quality, but otherwise remain simple and straight to the function with exception of symbolic pattern of @cyan @vines @and @flowers woven on the sides along length of the pants. They end just above the ankles leaving the feet exposed.
