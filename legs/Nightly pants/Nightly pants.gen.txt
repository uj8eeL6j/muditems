Crafted from midnight blue fabric these pants aim to provide luxurious comfort and warmth.  Tight and thick they protect wearer from foul weather and would have seemed rather simple at the first glance if not for exquisite thin thread of silver that forms the ornament of roses and daffodils covering the canvas of the pants. Staring at them you may notice faint blue mist traveling on the surface.
