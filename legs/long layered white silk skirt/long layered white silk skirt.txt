long layered white silk skirt
The skirt is crafted as cascade of layers of snow white silk, falling down from the waist. The material is extremely light, so it motions even with slight movement and weakest wind. The garment is monotonous in color of nearly blinding white, seeming almost like as field of drifing snow. Skirt ends at ground level, covers the feet entirely, and slightly drags over ground.
