crystalline gauntlets with silver veins
The gauntlets are fashioned from crystalline matter. They enclose arms entirely, even elbow is covered with neatly crafted joint, yet they leave fingers and palm exposed as hand is protected only from back side with plate. Main bodies of armor is crafted as semi-cylindrical plates that close onto each other with silver rivets. Elbow joint seems to be rather complex layer of plates, a mechanism to allow wearer to move in freedom. Each armor plate is bound into silver. Strange material itself is covered with veins of silvery metal.
