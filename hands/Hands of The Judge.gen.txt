The mechanics of them is brilliant, with adjustable joints carefully placed over entire length of an arm, allowing the wearer to move it with easy if they can bear its weight. @(bwhite,white)Cylindrical @(bwhite,white)plates that encase humerus and radius are carefully and elegantly @encrusted @with @golden @dragon @scales. The densely @(bwhite,white)plated gloves cover hands in metal. Each @(bwhite,white)plate on it is encrusted with @golden @edges. Knuckle caps each have a small @(cyan,green)malachite @(cyan,green)spheres fit into embossement in the middle. @(bwhite,white)Plates on the gloves fit so well they even cover hand from palm's side.
