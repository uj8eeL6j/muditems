Spider's Net
This mantle flows from chitin shoulder plates and feels to be a spider net of thick silk of pure blackness, with dark pearls embedded into joints. The plates seems to serve as only decorations, being small and not that hard, with hardeness of this garment provided by magic. The mantle feels as not that solid as spider's net has wide holes.
