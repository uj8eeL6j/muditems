lattice of shards
Seen as a shimmering star sky sky from a distance, this necklace displays itself as lattice of translucent ice shards shards on a numerous thin palladium chains. Lattice is rather huge and falls in numerous arcs onto the chest. Shards are great in numbers, each of them being small imperfect piece of enchanted ice, reflective, with visible inner cracks and textures.
