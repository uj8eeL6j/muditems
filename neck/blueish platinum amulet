blueish platinum amulet
The amulet is fashioned as tiny circle of platinum on a chain. Damascening on the circle fashioned out of silver depicts exquisitely detailed image of cat, sleeping tucked into a ball. The image is surrounded by ornamental wall of thorns, with spikes turned towards the cat. The other side of the amulet is rather simple, and displays similar inner-faced thread of thorns, but crafted as four-arm tight interwining spiral.
