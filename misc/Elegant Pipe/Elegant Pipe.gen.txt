An @elegant silverbark pipe
Long carving of the pipe is what which may catch the ones eye. It is an elegant creation with slight bent to it and knob for lips. Along its pearly surface the pipe holds an @ornament @of @placed @in @the @chaos @golden @runes. The carvings bowl is quite small and occurs to be a natural extension of the shaft.
