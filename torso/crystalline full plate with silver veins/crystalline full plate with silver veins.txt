crystalline full plate with silver veins
This armor is assembled out of several plates of crystalline matter with silvery veins, neatly fitting and outlining wearer's figure and protecting them from shoulders down to upper part of legs. Plates are rather big, but joint together by unknown method allowing some degree of agility. Plates that protect chest and back are joint in round, smooth shape over shoulders, with no separate shoulder plates.
