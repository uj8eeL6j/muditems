silvery blue hooded silk robe
Fashioned from bright blue and silvery white thick silk, ornamented at edges with silver interwining runic patterns, that appear to be in magical constant hypnotic serpent motion, the robe holds tightly to the body. At the back, there is embroidered image of silver metalic dragon trying to catch own tail in the flight. Wide hood forms smooth shape form right to left shoulder. Long and wide sleeves almost hide hands inside. Robe itself ends nearly at level of the ground, almost hiding feet. It has decoratively masked with layered fabric pockets for components.
