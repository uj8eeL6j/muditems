@Perfect @Robe
This robe is not simple by any means. Its canvas is made of long silken stripes woven together in v-shaped pattern, starting from neck down to the end. Each stripe has own @shade @of @cyan, from nearly black to the brightest. With time, stripes slowly exchange their colors but brightest ones always remain on top emphasizing the neckline. Overlapping of layers done from bottom to top and folds on the robe suggest that it has @countless @number @of @small @pockets. The skirt of robe has no sleeves and ends barely below the waist line suggesting it is not the only part of garment.
