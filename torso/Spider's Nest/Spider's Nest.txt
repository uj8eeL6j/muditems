Spider's Nest
The sea of dark purple, embroidered with golden pattern of spider's nest, fabric rises as this gown flows in cascades from ground to the waist. It opens wide in front, not hiding wearers legs and whats below the belly. Up from the waist the garment leans to the skin in glossy lame of pure darkness, emphasizing frame with little left to guessing, exposing belly in elliptic slit. Long neck of this vulgar dress ends with the bra, embroidered with spider leg pattern holding onto her breast.
