@Golden @(bwhite,white)Skin
This tight plate could be mistaken for woman's body, so perfectly and tightly it fits the wearer. @(bwhite,white)Two @(bwhite,white)pieces @(bwhite,white)of @(bwhite,white)well @(bwhite,white)polished @(bwhite,white)titanium forms most of this armour. Though seen rigid they bend with her body with ease, restricting movement with just their heavy weight. Looking closer you may notice multiple plackard lines fit together so carefully the armor looks like a second skin. Plate's canvas and wearer's curves are emphasized with @(borange,orange)golden @(borange,orange)encrustment, lines follow the curve from breast to bottom and @(borange,orange)dragon @(borange,orange)scales on the sides. Numerous @(cyan,green)tiny @(cyan,green)malachite @(cyan,green)spheres follow the pattern. Separated from the main piece of armor @(bwhite,white)two @(bwhite,white)oval @(bwhite,white)pouldrons cover the shoulders and with their second layer top of arms. Armor protects the wearer's neck with wide gorget formed out of several rings.
