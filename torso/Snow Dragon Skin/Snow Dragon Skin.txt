Snow Dragon Skin
This suit of blinding white breastplate is crafted out of strange material resembling hide of a white dragon. Surface of the armor is covered with thick white scales that are rather cold on touch and reflect the light as if were polished. Breastplate lays close to the wearer, stretching or shrinking to their shape, forming to fit their figure.
