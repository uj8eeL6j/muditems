These simply made sandals provide fair protection to the feet. Leater covers most of the skin, with carefully cut and pinned into simple patterns holes for air flow, and suede stripes used to tie sandals firmly to the feet. They overall look rather plain and are ment to be worn above socks or footwraps. Thist particular complect comes with black footwraps.
