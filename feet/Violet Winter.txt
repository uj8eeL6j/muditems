Violet Winter
These dyed dark violet feminine boots do look like as they are  created out of a single piece of scaled hide with no joints or stitches of any kind even near pitch black thin soles. Low heel on rubbery yet hard bottom presents the wearer with freedom of movement and protection from hazards of the ground. Boots are held tightly to the skin and are rather high, ending just a hand from kneels. Most of the surface of the boots is decorated with embossed vines and black roses.
