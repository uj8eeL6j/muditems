black wyvernhide riding boots

They are dyed into shades of nearly black cyan, look rather featureless on the inner side, but are covered with line of crystalline plates on the outer side. Heels on these boots are made of titanium, making them rather heavy alternative to spurs. Overall design of the boots suggests they are to be used mostly for riding.
