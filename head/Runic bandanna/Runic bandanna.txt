Runic bandanna
This piece of fabric is ment to be tied around the head as a stripe. It is silk canvas, with runes placed the way they form a spell if tied up properly. The material is of color of flaming orange with runes placed seemingly randomly on it when it is spread out. One could assume runes provide some fortification spell.
