crown of icicles
The crown is fashioned as cascade of frozen icicles descending in a low triangle from the front down to the sides of the crown's silver circlet. Each irregulat icicle grows seemingly naturally from rather plain, bounded at the edges, polished to the state of mirror circlet. The ice of icicles is filled with dislocations and texture: not entirely white, yet not transparent, the ice is not fragile, but seems to be.
