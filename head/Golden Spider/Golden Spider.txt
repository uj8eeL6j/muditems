Golden Spider
Huge golden spider with legs of black obsidian with frontal ones holding symbolic semi-transparent veil of black fabric over wearers face forms most of this unusual headdress. The spider creeps over woman's head, his black pearl eyes deadly staring into space just above the forehead. In its obsidian abdomen that raises over the head it holds a pure diamond, perhaps as symbol of the god. Its back legs support another veil of darkness, that falls from head and covers hair as spider's net.
