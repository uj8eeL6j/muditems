%^RESET%^%^RED%^This square piece of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^pelt%^RESET%^%^RED%^, carefully assembled of multiple patches of various shades of nearly %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^black gray %^RESET%^%^RED%^and dark - seemingly dyed - %^BOLD%^red%^RESET%^%^RED%^, is meant to be tied as headgear. %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Softness %^RESET%^%^RED%^of the fabric allows it to be folded into any fashion, but traces on the pelt indicate this particular piece is often used to cover mostly top of the head with knot on the back of it. Looking closer several %^WHITE%^mithril threads %^RED%^embedded into soft skin may be noticed, woven into fabric to provide additional strength. There is strange sensation of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^tranquility %^RESET%^%^RED%^near the fabric.%^WHITE%^
