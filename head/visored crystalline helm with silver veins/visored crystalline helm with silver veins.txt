visored crystalline helm with silver veins
This closed helmet seems to be crafted out of strange slightly transparent lightly cyan material covered in veins of silver metal. Main body of it seems to be of solid round shape, with two holes at the top bound on the inner side with melted into material silver rings. Bound in silver crystalline visor has two thin eye slits, carefully cut to stay against the eye. Round visor is held to the main body by circular silver rivets with  caps of inch in diameter each ornamented with symbolic eye. It covers entire face down to the chin, so when raised makes it visible. Veins on the material appear to be chaotically melted into it, with mo pattern at all. Edges of the helmet are bound with silver, with binding firmly melted into crystalline matter.
